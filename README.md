# Monte Hall Problem

A Simple Monte Hall Program that gives the user 3 doors one with a prize of a car and the other 2 with goats. 
The guest is then asked to select one of the doors which he things contains a car. The host then reveals one of the remaining two doors containing a goat
and asks the guest if he would like to stick with his inital answer or swap for the last remaining door. 

The general assumption is that once a door is removed each remaining door has a 50% chance of being correct while actually there 
is only a 33.3% chance that the car is behind the door initally selected and the other door has a 66.7% chance of being correct. 

So, statistically speaking, it makes sense to swap doors


V 2 - Rewrote the code using lists rather than dictionaries as they are indexable.
